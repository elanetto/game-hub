# GameHub
This is a school project from Noroff, created by a first-year student at FrontEnd Development.
The main task was to create an online store for (in this case) video games.

You can check out the deployed project [here](https://game-hub-lake-one.vercel.app/)

--> All links in the header works, and are linked to their own HTML-sites.

```bash
This is Anettes first big self-made HTML & CSS project
```

## Figma
Check out the Figma-file [here](https://www.figma.com/file/NR8oBgCk9eo5pMrmrAU59X/CA-Design?type=design&node-id=34%3A4&mode=design&t=aephNKcsxxDmi149-1)

PS: The Figma-file was created during another school project, 
where we learned how to design webites in Figma. 

## Material
The logo, the games and a brief was given from Noroff.
All other images used in banners, etc, are from PEXELS.
The AI-tool in Adobe Photoshop has also been used to edit some photos.

# Structure:

## HTML
The main HTML-files are visible from the get-go.
Other HTML-documents are stored in their own folder,
called "element-builder-html" - these are not part of the finished product.

## CSS
The CSS documents are all saved in a CSS-folder.
Each HTML-page is linked to the CSS-files they need.

## Assets
Images and favicons are sorted into folders within the assets-folder.
Most images have different sizes, for mobile, tablet and desktop.

# How was it built?
The layout is built with Flexbox, and Grid has not been used at all.

The site is entiarly built on HTML and CSS, and no JavaScript has been used.
