# GameHub
This is a school project from Noroff, created by a first-year student at FrontEnd Development.
The main task was to create an online store for (in this case) video games.

```bash
This is Anettes first big self-made HTML & CSS project
```

## Material
The logo, the games and a brief was given from Noroff.
All other images used in banners, etc, are from PEXELS.
The AI-tool in Adobe Photoshop has also been used to edit some photos.

```python
# Structure

## HTML
The main HTML-files are visible from the get-go.
Other HTML-documents are stored in their own folder,
called "element-builder-html" - these are not part of the finished product.

## CSS
The CSS documents are all saved in a CSS-folder.
Each HTML-page is linked to the CSS-files they need.

## Assets
Images and favicons are sorted into folders within the assets-folder.
Most images have different sizes, for mobile, tablet and desktop.
```

# How is i built?
The layout is built with Flexbox, and Grid has not been used at all.
