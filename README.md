[GameHub - Deployed project](https://game-hub-lake-one.vercel.app/)

## Description
This is a school project from Noroff, created by a first-year student at FrontEnd Development.
The main task was to create an online store for (in this case) video games.

- Create a webstore
- Use HTML and CSS
- Use the given materials of logos and product-images

```bash
This was my first big self-made HTML & CSS project
```
## Tools and technology
My portfolio is built with HTML and CSS, and it was first designed and planned in Figma.

## Figma
Check out the Figma-file [here](https://www.figma.com/file/NR8oBgCk9eo5pMrmrAU59X/CA-Design?type=design&node-id=34%3A4&mode=design&t=aephNKcsxxDmi149-1)

## Material
- The logo, the games and a brief was given from Noroff.
- All other images used in banners, etc, are from PEXELS.
- The AI-tool in Adobe Photoshop has also been used to edit some photos.

## Structure:

HTML

The main HTML-files are visible from the get-go.
Other HTML-documents are stored in their own folder,
called "element-builder-html" - these are not part of the finished product.

CSS

The CSS documents are all saved in a CSS-folder.
Each HTML-page is linked to the CSS-files they need.

ASSETS

Images and favicons are sorted into folders within the assets-folder.
Most images have different sizes, for mobile, tablet and desktop.

# How was it built?
The layout is built with Flexbox, and Grid has not been used at all.

The site is entiarly built on HTML and CSS, and no JavaScript has been used.

## How was the process?
I wanted the site to be colourful and fun. I wanted to challange myself to use yellow in the layout.
The layout was the most challenging part, especially sinse this was my first HTML and CSS project.

## Learning Points & self assesment
I learned a lot from this project: Both what to do, and what not to do.
One thing I did learn here was not to set so rigid sizes on the divs with px, and rather use rem and padding to do that.

I also learned a lot about @media in CSS.

This was a challenging and fun assignment.
